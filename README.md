# SIQA

**SIQA** (Intelligent Air Quality System) was developed in 2025 for the course `SSC5972 - Internet of Things` at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

The goal of SIQA is to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the course by developing a project that enables remote monitoring and control of air quality metrics in a laboratory environment.

The measurements obtained from sensors are:

- _Humidity_
- _Temperature_
- _CO2_
- _VOC_
